The for allows us to specify three things about a loop in single line
(a) Setting a loop counter to an initial value.
(b) Testing the loop counter to determine whether its value has
reached the number of repetitions desired.
(c) Increasing the value of loop counter each time the program
segment within the loop has been executed.
